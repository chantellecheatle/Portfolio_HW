The aim of the project was to create a site which was easily accessible for the user and ease communication for people wishing to donate.
                    Our team worked on redesigning the Riding for the Disabled site with the goal to create a beautiful yet simple to design for both the user and stakeholders.

                  <div class="ip-body">Initially user testing was conducted to gain an understanding of what was missing from the current RDASA and what were the areas of improvement. After speaking with 5 users we then spoke with the stakeholder of the company to better understand their goal and what they wanted their site to convey to the audience. 

                    Having gathered all the necessary information we began researching our user on a deeper level through the use of empathy maps and photo personas. From here we were able to form a series of user flows to better understand the journey the current site took the user and therefore review the areas that were no longer beneficial.</div>

                  <div class="final-body">The ideation process began with aiming to create a simple, clean design which appealed to the user. Our team developed a revised user flow which then lead to a lo-fidelity prototype. Once the prototype was ready, we conducted a second round of user testing to ensure the new site design would appeal to the user and stakeholders. 

                    From our lo-fidelity prototype we began working on a hi-fidelity prototype which we could use for developer handover in the near future.</div>
