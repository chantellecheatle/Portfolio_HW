To ensure the designs were user friendly a lo-fidelity prototype was developed using wireframing. Using the first prototype user tesing was again conducted. Users were set 3 simple tasks to complete through the app to ensure easy accessability. Once we could ensure a simple user friendly design had been achieved we were able to begin pushing the prototype to hi-fidelity to present to stakeholders. </div>
